         <p class="main-text">The Maine Ð¡oon has a strong body with well-developed muscles and strong paws. They have a square muzzle with large, wide-set ears. The fur is long and dense, and the undercoat is covered with a shiny, thick and waterproof upper coat. The hair on the head, neck and shoulders is shorter and lengthens towards the tail and sides. On the belly and "breeches" the coat is thick and shaggy. <br> On the neck there is a collar from the very base of the ears, and in males it is larger and heavier. On the tail, the hair is long and falls as if in waves. There are tassels on the ears. There are tufts on the paws, so they resemble snowshoes. The Maine cat breed can have more than 30 color options. The eyes can be green, golden, or coppery, while white cats have blue or multi-colored eyes.</p>

         <p class="text">Maine have a very cuddly personality, and they are playful and friendly. They enjoy being in the company of people and make great family pets. Perhaps because of their unpretentious origins, they often curl up in a ball in the most unexpected places. They like life outside, they need to be able to climb a hill and simulate hunting. Maine are known for their adorable, quiet chirping.</p>

         <h2 class="title">Provenance</h2>
         <p class="text"><span>Country of origin: United States of America</span>The ancestors of Maine cats were long-haired cats, which were brought to the US state of Maine by sailors in the 1850s. They mated with local shorthair cats. Their offspring were large, had a strong body, medium-length fur and brush-tails similar to the tail of a raccoon, from which the name came: Maine ("raccoon from Maine"). To protect them from the harsh local winter, these cats have grown thick and dense fur.  As early as the 1860s, special shows of Maine cats were held, and they became very popular as pets. Maine were brought to the UK in the 1980s.</p>
